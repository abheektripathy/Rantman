### Architecture Overview

Rantman is built using a microservices architecture, with each component of the app running in its own Docker container. The architecture consists of the following components:

- **Frontend:** The frontend of the app is built using Next.js, a React framework for building server-side rendered web applications. The frontend is served by Nginx, which acts as a reverse proxy and load balancer. Nginx is responsible for distributing incoming requests across multiple instances of the frontend containers, ensuring that the load is balanced evenly across them.
- **Backend:** The backend of the app is built using Django, a Python web framework. The backend is served by Gunicorn, a Python WSGI HTTP Server, and communicates with the frontend via a RESTful API. The backend containers are managed by Kubernetes, which ensures that the backend containers are always available and responsive.
- **Database:** The database for the app is built using Postgres, a powerful open-source relational database management system. The database container is also managed by Kubernetes, ensuring that the database is always available and responsive.
- **Container Orchestration:** The containers for the app are managed and orchestrated by Kubernetes, a popular open-source container orchestration platform. Kubernetes is responsible for deploying, scaling, and managing the Docker containers for the app, ensuring that the containers are running smoothly and efficiently.

```

This will start the app in development mode.


Here are a few ideas for marketing and pitching your project:

1. Emphasize the scalability and flexibility of the architecture: With the use of Docker containers, Docker Compose, and Kubernetes orchestration, your notes app can be scaled easily and flexibly to handle increased traffic and usage. This means that your app can handle growth without compromising performance or stability.
2. Highlight the use of modern technologies: Using modern technologies like Docker
